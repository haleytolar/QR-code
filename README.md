## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design with media queries
- Mobile and desktop breakpoints

### What I learned

Through this project, I gained experience with creating responsive layouts that maintain consistent proportions across different screen sizes. I particularly focused on:

- Using flexbox for centering and vertical alignment
- Working with box shadows for subtle depth effects
- Managing proportions between mobile and desktop views with media queries
- Creating a responsive component that adapts to different screen sizes

I implemented a responsive approach that uses fixed widths on mobile and viewport-relative units on desktop. This approach ensures the component looks good on mobile devices while scaling proportionally on larger screens.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Further refine my responsive design approach for various screen sizes
- Explore more advanced CSS techniques for creating visually appealing components
- Improve accessibility features by adding proper ARIA attributes and focus states
- Learn more about performance optimization for faster loading times
- Practice creating more complex layouts while maintaining clean, maintainable code

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs on Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me understand flexbox layout concepts and how to properly center elements.
- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - An excellent visual guide that breaks down flexbox properties.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) - The challenges on this platform provide great opportunities to practice and improve HTML/CSS skills.
